### Sudoku Solution Validator using Multithreading

#### Description:

This program validates a Sudoku solution using multithreading in C. It checks whether a given Sudoku puzzle adheres to the rules of the game, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains the digits 1 through 9 without repetition.

#### Solution Intuition:

1. **Multithreading Approach**: The program creates multiple threads to concurrently validate different aspects of the Sudoku puzzle.

2. **Thread Creation**: Separate threads are created to check rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids.

3. **Parameter Passing**: Each thread receives parameters indicating the starting row and column to validate.

4. **Validation Functions**:

   - `isValidRow`: Checks if each row contains the digits 1 through 9 without repetition.
   - `isValidColumn`: Checks if each column contains the digits 1 through 9 without repetition.
   - `isValidSquare`: Checks if each 3x3 subgrid contains the digits 1 through 9 without repetition.

5. **Result Handling**: Each thread sets a `result` flag indicating whether its corresponding region of the Sudoku puzzle is valid. The main thread waits for all threads to complete and checks the result flags to determine the overall validity of the Sudoku solution.

#### Usage:

1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc) at the correct path.
   `gcc -o sudoku-solution-validator sudoku-solution-validator.c -lpthread`
2. Run the executable, it will validate the pre-defined solution for Sudoku puzzle.
   `./sudoku-solution-validator`
3. The program will output whether the Sudoku solution is valid or not.
